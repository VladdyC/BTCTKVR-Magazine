To get the genuine BTCTKVR magazine experience, ask your local print shop to use 300g glossy paper for the cover and 150g matte paper for the pages. The format should be A4. This way, your print will be a joy to hold in your hands and everyone receiving a copy will feel impressed.

4. Download the covers from here: https://github.com/VladdyC/BTCTKVR-Magazine/blob/main/BTCTKVR%20FOSS%20Magazine%20Covers.pdf
5. That's it, you're good to go. Send the two PDFs (pages + covers) to your local print shop and enjoy the genuine BTCTKVR experience. This is the power of open source!

For the already-compiled PDF, check out this file. However, keep in mind that some print shops will ask you to send the pages and the covers separately because they use different types of paper and must bind these parts together. So it's always better to download the PDF for the covers and then compile the pages JPGs into a large PDF (as described above).
